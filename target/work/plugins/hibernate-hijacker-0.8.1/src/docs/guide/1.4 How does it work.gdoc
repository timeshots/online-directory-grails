[See this post for a summary of some of the difficulties involved with this|http://grails.1312388.n4.nabble.com/Why-aren-t-the-session-bound-to-thread-during-requests-when-I-proxy-the-sessionFactory-bean-td2893502.html#a2893502].

Hibernate's SessionFactory is constructed as usual and wrapped with a proxy. The proxy does two things:

# Publishes session instances returned by the openSession methods via the event broker. 
# Intercepts calls to getCurrentSession and delegates them to an instance of CurrentSessionContext we have initiated with a reference to the SessionFactory **proxy** instead of the actual object. This is great because it allows us to support webflows without introducing a compile time dependency to the webflow plugin.
